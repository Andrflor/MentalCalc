This is a simple math tool to improve speed in mental calculus (aka mult and
add)

## Commands

	x           to switch mult and add
	Escape      to reset the bottom right counter
	Space       to show result or get new operation

## Caution
This program should be responsive but may not fit some screen geometry.
It may also integer overflow when multipling the highest numbers

## Build
You need qt5 to build this program
Using qmake

```
git clone https://github.com/Andrflor/MentalCalc.git
cd MentalCalc
qmake .
make
```

Then you should be able to run the calc binary
